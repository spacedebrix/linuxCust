SUBJECT: Getting onClick to work

INFO:
   This is in relation to getting onClick to work with the whole layout,
   a RelativeLayout in this case.

   What SHOULD work is simply adding this in the activity's XML for
   the layout (or whatever):

      android:onClick="myOnClickMethod"

   Then the method should look like:

      public void myOnClickMethod(View view) {
         // Who cares about view
      }


   ------------------
   If for some reason that isn't working, REBUILD the entire project.  I
   messed around for 20 minutes last time before trying that and that's
   all it took.

   If for some reason that's not working, some other things to try:

   - Add clickable to activity XML (I have no idea why this isn't required
     to begin with):
   
        android:clickable="true"


   - Add listener programatically:

        RelativeLayout relativeLayout = (RelativeLayout)findViewById(R.id.activity_encourage);

        relativeLayout.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View view) {
                goBack(view);
            }
        });

   - Turn activity into listener:

        public class Encourage extends AppCompatActivity implements View.OnClickListener {
           ...
           @Override
           public void onClick(View view ) {}
           ...
        }

   Experiment with adding the XML clickable to any of these options.
